### CoderzColumn : Developed for Developers by Developers for betterment of Development.

### About 
We developed coderzcolumn for sharing knowledge on various topics like SEO, Android, Python, Data Science, Machine Learning/ Deep Learning.

Apart from them, we are also planning to include explanation of research papers in simple language avoiding complicated mathematics part and will try to include implementations as well.

### Technologies used for development
CoderzColumn is developed using Python3 (v3.6.4), Django (v2.1) for server side development and frontend is developed using HTML and bootstrap (v4.1.3). We are using SQLite DB for backend. We'll be migrating to PostgreSQL in future.
